Cenny.js is now Argon.
#The Argon Project
Argon is an open source JS and PHP based backend that just works. Sets up in seconds and runs on almost any server. Argon makes it easy for anyone to create interactive, multi-user web apps, without the need for a third-party backend.

##The success of this project is up to you. 
We're looking for awesome developers who want to contribute to the project. Go ahead and experiment with Argon, if you see something you don't like or think could be better, fix it and submit a pull request! Or if you're not comfortable with PHP and Javascript, just let us know and we'll try and fix it. Thanks!
